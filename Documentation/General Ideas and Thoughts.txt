Should recipes have reviews?

I think EVERYTHING gets loaded (all requests made and everything rendered) whenever the landing page is generated. Look into making the requests and loading the data ONLY when required.

For images, every time one is displayed, I believe a request is made to the backend. This can make for a hell of a lot of requests, is there a way to send all the required images at once?
